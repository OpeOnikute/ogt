# OGT README #

OGT stands for Ope's Graphic Tool (Kent blame me)

### What is this repository for? ###
This is a dashboard application i'm building to manage my graphic design work. 
The goal is to be able to do all the administrative stuff from the dashboard. i.e. Talk to clients, generate invoices, send emails etc.

It's not open source rn, i'm not sure it ever will be.
